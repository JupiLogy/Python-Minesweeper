# Python Minesweeper
It's minesweeper written in python, as simple as that, I wrote this a few years ago (and probably haven't improved much since).

Tk was used for the user interface and other than that it's just my own spaghetti code.

## Instructions

#### Linux Mint
```
sudo apt-install python3-tk
python3 minesweeper.py
```
